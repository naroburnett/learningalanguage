# Introduction
Congratulations on making it to the 4th step! You've come a long way from having no project to having a basic idea where you want to be at the end of your new project. So far you should have picked an idea for what you want to do for this project set some S.M.A.R.T  goals, pick the language to do the project in, set up your project environment by deciding on what IDE you want to use, your repositories, and even set up a device to do your project on. All along the way, you should have done some research here in there, but here we're going to be all in when it comes to learning what we need to learn to meet our goals.

# Learn the Fundamentals of the Language
The fundamentals of any programming language typically include the following concepts:

* **Syntax:** The way code is written and structured in a specific programming language.

* **Data Types:** Different types of data, such as integers, strings, and arrays, used in a programming language.

* **Variables:** Named locations in memory used to store data.

* **Operators:** Symbols used to perform operations on data, such as mathematical operations or string concatenation.

* **Control Flow:** The ability to control the flow of a program's execution, such as through the use of if-else statements, loops, and function calls.

* **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times within a program.

* **Arrays and Collections:** Data structures that allow for the storage and manipulation of multiple data elements.

* **Input and Output:** Mechanisms for getting data into and out of a program.

* **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing errors in a program.

While the specifics of these concepts may vary between programming languages, they form the foundation of most modern programming languages. Understanding these fundamentals will give you a strong foundation for learning any programming language.

# Tutorials, Walkthoughs, and How To's
We live in the age of information! There are videos and guides for everything, especially when it comes to programming! So a good place to start is by looking up tutorials on the internet.

You can also use these search terms with additional keywords related to your specific needs, such as "game development" or "web development". Additionally, you can add "video" or "article" to your search query to specifically look for video tutorials or written articles.

# There is Power in Numbers and the Community is Endless
The power of the programming community should not be underestimated when it comes to learning a new programming language. Joining online forums, discussion groups, or social media communities dedicated to the language you are learning can provide you with an abundance of resources, including tutorials, examples, and practical tips. You can also ask questions and receive support from other members, who may have faced similar challenges as you, and have helpful insights to share. 

Additionally, participating in the community can help you stay motivated and on track with your learning goals. The community can also provide opportunities for collaboration and networking, which can be invaluable in advancing your career. Overall, engaging with the programming community is an essential component of your learning journey and can]h(elp you make the most out of your experience.

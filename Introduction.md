# Introduction
Congratulations on taking the first step towards becoming fluent in a programming language! Don't worry if you are overwhelmed, that is natural and normal. You have to remember that much like learning any other language it takes time, effort, and practice. So, lets take things one step at a time.

# Planning the Journey
 Before you can take your first step, you need to know where you want to go! Otherwise, you will just wander aimlessly. Lewis Carroll the author of "Alice and the Wonderland" relates this perfectly with the interactions of Alice and the Cheshire Cat:

 ```
 “Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?

The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.

Alice: I don't much care where.

The Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.

Alice: ...So long as I get somewhere.

The Cheshire Cat: Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.”
```

We want to know where we want to go, so we can get to our destination in the simplest way possible and to avoid any unnecessary steps, and minimize falling into any rabbit holes! When we know where to go, in many cases it can also provide us with motivation to also get there!

# Brainstorming
Don't worry if you don't have an idea right off the bat! Most often you will have to take some time to come up with some ideas. There are many ways to do this! A great place to start is by asking yourself some thoughtful questions:

* What skills or knowledge do I want to gain or improve upon?
* What problem or challenge do I want to solve?
* What do I enjoy doing or find interesting?
* What is something that I have always wanted to create or build?
* What would be a meaningful and impactful project for me?
* What resources do I have available to me?
* What are the constraints or limitations that I need to consider?
* What do I want to learn more about or explore?
* What can I create that will bring value to others?

As you are asking yourself these questions you might want to consider writing your thoughts down somewhere! There are many tools and different options available depending on what best works for you!

Here is a list of some common brainstorming techniques that are used professionally:

1. Mind Mapping
2. Word Banking
3. S.C.A.M.P.E.R
4. S.W.O.T Analysis
5. Zero Draft
6. Reverse Brainstorming

You may even consider brainstorming with some peers or mentors! Bouncing off ideas with people can be very helpful and help provide insights that you wouldn't have though about otherwise! 

# The Project, The Goals, and the Objectives. 
When coming up with a personal project its important to know the difference between the project, the goals, and the objectives. 

A **Project** is a temporary effort with a specific end goal in mind. It is a unique set of tasks, activities, and resources that are planned and executed to achieve that end goal or accomplish the set purpose.

*i.e Learning Python*

**Goals** are the overarching targets that you want to achieve through your project. They are typically long-term and broader in scope, and they provide the direction for your project.

*i.e create a basic program in python*

**Objectives** are specific, measurable, and time-bound targets that support the achievement of your project goals. They are more concrete and actionable than goals and provide a clear roadmap for your project. Objectives help you stay focused, measure progress, and make adjustments as needed to ensure that you reach your project goals.

*i.e Learn how to do if statements in python*

# S.M.A.R.T. Goals
Setting clear and achievable goals is crucial for success in both personal and professional life. S.M.A.R.T. goals provide a framework for setting goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By using the S.M.A.R.T. method, you can create goals that are well-defined, focused, and achievable.

**Specific**

Make your goals specific and well-defined. Be clear about what you want to achieve, why it is important, and how you plan to achieve it. When setting specific goals, it is helpful to use the following questions:

* What do I want to accomplish?
* Why is this goal important to me?
* How will I achieve this goal?

**Measurable**

In order to track progress and measure success, it's important to set goals that are measurable. Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will help you evaluate your progress and determine when you have reached your goal. When setting measurable goals, it is helpful to use the following questions:

* How will I know when I have achieved this goal?
* What metrics will I use to track my progress?
* What data will I need to collect to measure success?

**Achievable**

Make sure your goals are realistic and achievable, given your resources and constraints. Consider your skills, experience, and current situation when setting achievable goals. When setting achievable goals, it is helpful to use the following questions:

* Can I realistically achieve this goal given my resources and constraints?
* What will I need to do to achieve this goal?
* What support or resources will I need to achieve this goal?

**Relevant**

Ensure that your goals are relevant and aligned with your larger vision and priorities. Make sure that your goals are meaningful and impactful for you and that they align with your values and purpose. When setting relevant goals, it is helpful to use the following questions:

* Why is this goal important and relevant to me?
* How does this goal align with my larger vision and priorities?
* What impact will this goal have on my life and others?

**Time-bound**

Set a deadline for your goals and make sure they are time-bound. This will help you stay focused, prioritize your tasks, and ensure that you are making progress towards your goals. When setting time-bound goals, it is helpful to use the following questions:

* When do I want to achieve this goal?
* What is the timeline for achieving this goal?
* What milestones do I need to hit along the way?

**Conclusion**

By following the S.M.A.R.T. goal-setting framework, you can create goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This will help you stay focused, prioritize your tasks, and make meaningful progress towards your vision. Remember to celebrate your successes and make adjustments along the way as needed.

# Conclusion
The planning process will set the tone for your entire project. If it is scattered, your project will be scattered. If it is organized, your project will be organized. 

Remember you are simply creating a plan! You are NOT predicting the future. You may need to adjust your plan in the future and that is okay! Creating a plan is to point you in the right direction anf help you know where to begin and where you want to hopefully end.

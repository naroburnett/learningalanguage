# Introduction
So you picked a project or at least have a rough idea on what you want to do! Amazing job! Now if you haven't already you need to pick a programming language to work with! Picking a language to learn is an exciting and important first step in your journey, and sets the foundation for the rest of your learning experience. By choosing the right language for your needs and goals, you'll be able to focus your efforts and make the most out of your time and resources. Whether you're interested in building websites, creating apps, or developing software, there's a language that's perfect for you. And the great thing is, once you've mastered one language, it becomes much easier to learn others. So embrace the opportunity, pick a language, and get ready to dive in!

# Picking out a Language
Choosing the right programming language for your personal project can be a challenging task, but it's also an important one. Here are some factors to consider when making your choice:

1. Purpose of the project: What problem are you trying to solve with your project? Different programming languages are better suited for different types of problems. 

    *For example, Python is great for scientific computing and data analysis, while JavaScript is ideal for building interactive web applications.*

2. Your experience and skills: What programming languages are you already familiar with? If you already have experience in a particular language, it may make sense to use that language for your project. On the other hand, if you're looking to expand your skills, choosing a new language can be a great opportunity to learn and grow.

3. Community and resources: A strong community and abundance of resources can make a big difference when working on a personal project. Consider the size and activity level of the community, as well as the availability of libraries, documentation, and tutorials.

4. Project requirements: What are the specific requirements of your project? Some programming languages may have better support for certain features, such as graphics or parallel processing.

5. Future plans: Do you plan on sharing or commercializing your project in the future? Consider the ecosystem and the potential for growth and scalability in the language you choose.

6. Long Term Career: Does the language have future benefit for you and your future career? What programming languages are most sought after in your field? Taking this into consideration could help you develop valuable and sought after skills.

## Helpful Information to Get Started
### Introduction
To help you get started on the process of deciding what language to use for your personal project, I have compiled a small list of the top 5 programming languages and their strengths. This is not a comprehensive list and should not be the only thing you do to help make your decision.

It is encouraged that you do some of your own research and look into maybe not just what is easiest, but what is most valuable to you and your future!

### Top 5 programing Languages
1. Python: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in various applications such as scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and web development. It has a large and active community, and is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.

2. Java: Java is an object-oriented, cross-platform language that is widely used in developing enterprise applications, web applications, and mobile applications. It is known for its portability, security, and scalability.

3. JavaScript: JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is used primarily for creating interactive web applications and browser scripting. It has a large and active community, and is widely used in front-end web development in combination with HTML and CSS.

4. C++: C++ is a high-level, statically-typed, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in developing operating systems, games, and other high-performance applications. It is known for its performance, low-level access, and compatibility with other languages.

5. C#: C# is a high-level, statically-typed, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in developing Windows desktop applications, games, and mobile applications. It is known for its simplicity, elegance, and its integration with the .NET framework.

# Introduction
If you have made it this far you not only have picked a project, but you have also decided on a language. The next step is to set up your environment for your project. This includes everything from your IDE of choice to repositories to language libraries. 

```
"You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?"  - W. Clement Stone
```

# Project Managers/To-Do-Lists
If you haven't already, having a method to keep yourself organized and accountable is vital to the success and workflow of any project especially in projects when you have multiple team members. In any case, it is recommended that you set up some system to stay organized and keep yourself accountable. Their are many different ways for you to address this from old fashioned planners to high-tech programs. 

One popular modern management program is **Trello**. Which is a web-based project management tool that uses a visual, board-style interface, where you can create boards for different projects and add cards for tasks or items you need to work on. You can also add labels, due dates, attachments, and other information to each card to help you manage your project, goals, and tasks. Did I mention there is a free plan?

# Repositories
Repositories are a must for any Programming Project as it allows for collaboration, version control, storing, and backing up projects. The most popular repository is **Github**. Look into how you want to set yours up and what tools you want to use to manage your repository and interact with it.

Here are a few things to consider when picking repositories and how to access them:

**Compatibility:** Make sure the repository you choose is compatible with the programming language and technology stack you are using. Some repositories may only support specific programming languages or technologies, so be sure to check this before choosing one.

**Storage capacity:** Consider the amount of data and files you will be storing in your repository, and choose a repository with enough storage capacity to accommodate your needs.

**Accessibility:** Make sure the repository you choose is accessible and easy to use. Some repositories may require authentication, while others may be publicly accessible. Consider the level of security you need and choose a repository that meets your needs.

**Integration:** Consider how the repository integrates with other tools you are using, such as development environments, issue trackers, or continuous integration tools. The more seamlessly the repository integrates with other tools, the more efficient and productive you can be.

**Cost:** Repositories can vary in price, so consider your budget when choosing one. Some repositories may offer free basic plans, while others may require a paid subscription for more advanced features.

To access a repository, you will typically need to create an account and sign in. From there, you can create new repositories, clone existing ones, and push changes to them. You can typically access repositories through a web-based interface, or using Git command-line tools. The exact process for accessing a repository will vary depending on the repository you choose, so be sure to consult their documentation for specific instructions.


# IDE
Here are a few steps to help you pick the right IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for your programming needs:

**Identify your needs:** Before choosing an IDE, it's important to understand what kind of projects you will be working on, what programming languages you'll be using, and what specific features you need in an IDE (e.g. debugging, code completion, version control, etc.).

**Research and compare:** Look for different IDEs that support the programming languages you'll be using, and compare their features and user reviews. Some popular IDEs include **Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Sublime Text**.

**Test it out:** Once you've narrowed down your options, try using a few of the IDEs you're considering to get a feel for their interface and functionality. Some IDEs offer free trials or limited versions, so you can try them before making a decision.

**Consider ease of use:** Choose an IDE that is user-friendly and easy for you to navigate. You want an IDE that you can use efficiently, without having to spend a lot of time learning how to use it.

**Think about integration:** Consider how the IDE integrates with other tools you use, such as version control systems or collaboration platforms. The more seamlessly the IDE integrates with other tools, the more efficient and productive you can be.

Remember, the right IDE will vary depending on your personal needs and preferences, so it's important to take the time to choose an IDE that works best for you.

# Language Libraries
Not all languages are created equal! Some languages if not most require to install packages to run on your IDE and computer. Most IDE's have setup options when you first set them up to also install various languages, but you should ALWAYS check and see if you have all the proper libraries and packages installed on your computer for the language you are wanting to work with, otherwise good luck trying to do your project. 

A good place to find instructions on setting up your IDE and computer for your respective language is online. Most if not all languages have decent documentation that takes you through the initial setup/install process. There are also hundreds of videos and walkthrough guides available through places like youtube and w3schools.

# Chapter Check List
1. Do some research
2. Pick an IDE and Repository
3. Install the IDE and Repository
4. Install the appropriate Language Libraries
5. Watch some tutorial videos on your tools. Get familiar with them.

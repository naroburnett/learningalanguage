# Introduction
If you have made it this far you not only have picked a project, but you have also decided on a language. The next step is to set up your environment for your project. This includes everything from your IDE of choice to repositories to language libraries.

"You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?"  - W. Clement Stone

# Project Managers/To-Do-Lists
If you haven't already, having a method to keep yourself organized and accountable is vital to the success and workflow of any project especially in projects when you have multiple team members. In any case, it is recommended that you set up some system to stay organized and keep yourself accountable. Their are many different ways for you to address this from old fashioned planners to high-tech programs. 

One popular modern management program is **Trello**. Which is a web-based project management tool that uses a visual, board-style interface, where you can create boards for different projects and add cards for tasks or items you need to work on. You can also add labels, due dates, attachments, and other information to each card to help you manage your project, goals, and tasks. Did I mention there is a free plan?

# Repositories
Repositories are a must for any Programming Project as it allows for collaboration, version control, storing, and backing up projects. The most popular repository is **Github**. Look into how you want to set yours up and what tools you want to use to manage your repository and interact with it.

* Do you want to use an IDE extension? A septate application? Your CDM?

It is encouraged that you do some research and get familiar with your repository of choice. 


# IDE
If you hope to write in any programming language it is a must to have the proper IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

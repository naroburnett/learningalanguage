# Overview

Welcome to your journey of learning a new coding language! Learning a new programming language can be an exciting and fulfilling experience, and is a great way to expand your skill set and improve your career prospects. The key to success is taking things one step at a time and approaching the process with a positive attitude. With a step-by-step approach, you'll be able to build your confidence and make steady progress towards your goal of mastering a new coding language. So, let's get started!

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and accessible guide to learning a new coding language. The inspiration for this project stems from my personal experience of feeling overwhelmed when starting from scratch. I realized that many others may also struggle with the same feelings of confusion and frustration, and I wanted to provide a solution that would make the process of learning a new coding language easier and more manageable. With this guide, I aim to help anyone who is looking to learn a new coding language, regardless of their current level of experience or background. My goal is to make the journey of learning a new coding language as smooth and stress-free as possible, and to empower individuals to take control of their education and reach their goals.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
